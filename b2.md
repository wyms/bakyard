BAKYARD APP — Uber Marketplace Model + Claude
Max Build Specification

1. Core Product Vision

Build Bakyard as a marketplace engine similar to Uber Eats — a discovery-based feed of bookable
experiences. Supply = Courts, Coaches, Events, Food. Demand = Players, Crews, Parents. Focus on
frictionless booking, recurring revenue, and scalable supply creation.

2. Marketplace Structure
Everything is a Product Card in a vertical feed: • Court Rental • Open Play • Coaching Session •
Tournament • Community Day • Food Add-On Each card contains: Title, Time Window, Capacity, Tags,
Price, CTA (Book / RSVP).

3. MVP Revenue Engine
Primary: • Court Rentals (dynamic peak/off-peak pricing) • Open Play • Membership recurring billing
Secondary: • Coaching sessions • Event registration • Food add-ons Pricing Model (Recommended
Start): Court Rentals: $80–$140/hr depending on demand. Open Play: $20–$45 per player. Private
Coaching: $90–$140/hr. Memberships: $49 / $99 / $199 tiers.

4. Booking & Payment Logic
Booking Flow: Product → Select Time → Confirm → Add Extras → Pay → Session Hub Payments: •
Stripe (Card + Apple Pay) • Split Payments (individual or host pay) • Auto-reminders for unpaid players
• Cancellation policy configurable by admin

5. Membership Model (Uber One Equivalent)
Local Player: $49/month (discount + priority booking) Sand Regular: $99/month (larger discount +
guest pass) Founders Circle: Invite-only premium tier Membership benefits: • Early booking window •
Auto-discount applied at checkout • Badge in profile

6. Session Hub (Logistics Layer)
Each booking creates a session hub including: • Date/time + court • Address (tap for maps) • Weather
snapshot • Roster + payment status • Light logistics chat • Invite link

7. Coach Portal

Message players • Track attendance Revenue share configurable via admin.

8. Admin Console

Web-based dashboard: • Create/edit products • Dynamic pricing rules • Court availability toggle •
Weather status override • Membership management • Refunds & cancellations • Revenue reporting

9. Claude Max Integration (AI Layer)
Claude Max used for: • Feed ranking optimization • Personalized session recommendations • Smart
notification suggestions • Admin pricing insights (demand prediction) • Coach performance summaries •
Member retention analysis Claude should operate as advisory intelligence, not control logic. Core
booking engine must remain deterministic.

10. Data Objects (Core Schema)
User Product Session Court Order Membership CoachProfile Each must support real-time locking and
status updates.

11. MVP Timeline (4 Weeks)

reliability, payments, and marketplace supply growth. • Keep UI minimal, warm, and premium.
